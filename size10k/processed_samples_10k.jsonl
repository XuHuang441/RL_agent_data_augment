Context: Near East (French: Proche-Orient) is a geographical term that roughly encompasses Western Asia.

Question: If they were not Italian, what were Rome's allies? Context: Rome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the Socii, such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in alae, or wings, roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.\nAns: Greek\n\nExtract the answer to the question from the following context.

Question: What vehicles did aircraft carriers have on them? Context: The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-2.71875, -2.71875, -1.8125, -2.71875, -2.71875], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it bundles several short-answer extraction tasks that require: precise coreference resolution (identifying what pronouns like \\\"they\\\" or \\\"they\\\" refer to), mapping a question word like \\\"who\\\" to the correct semantic type (e.g., a language, its speakers, or a group of people), named-entity recognition, and simple list/ordinal reasoning (picking the Nth item from an enumeration).

By 1966, the British government had come to the conclusion that it could no longer afford to govern what is now the United Arab Emirates. Much deliberation took place in the British parliament, with a number of MPs arguing that the Royal Navy would not be able to defend the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Denis Healey, who, at the time, was the UK Secretary of State for Defence, reported that the British Armed Forces were severely overextended, and in some respects, dangerously under-equipped to defend the Sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the decision to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms which had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection.

The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage.\nPROBLEM: The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels. There is criticism that American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.\n\nSOLUTION: What was the catalyst that created greater interest in renewable resources?\n\nPROBLEM: A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.\n\nSOLUTION: Who oversees a Pharmacy Technician in the UK?\n\nPROBLEM: Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O\n2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O\n2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O\n2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.\n\nSOLUTION:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-0.57421875, -0.57421875, -0.57421875, 5.53125, -0.57421875], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This task is challenging because it combines precise instruction-following with reading comprehension: the model must (1) understand the distinction between an extractive, single-entity answer (a person, date, place, organization, or number) and other answer types (yes/no, lists, phrases), (2) craft a clear, unambiguous question whose answer can be found verbatim in the passage, and (3) avoid producing multiple questions or supplying the answer.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.\n\n[EX Q]: Article: The first tape recorder didn't use tape. It used long thin wire. It was invented in 1900 by Valdermar Poulsen. In 1930, German scientists invented the tape we use today. Back then the tape was on big rolls. In 1964 the Philips company in Holland invented the cassette. It's pretty much a holder for the tape. People use cassettes all over the world. If you don't have a cassette recorder, borrow one. Think of a book your parents read out loud to you. That might be a great book to read out loud to your mom or dad in their car. Put a cassette in the recorder, open the book, hit the record button and start reading out loud. Remember there is no such a thing as a wrong way to do this. You might think you've made a mistake, but this gift is part of you, and nothing about that can be a mistake. It's impossible. You get to be all artistic and creative here. You might want to play music in the background. Do whatever you want. The gift is you, so you decide. Remember to say \"I love you\"at the end of your reading. That's like the prize at the end of the book. \n Answer: To practice reading out loud.\n[EX A]: What does the author advise us to do?\n\n[EX Q]: Article: Oprah Winfrey is not just a very successful TV personality  in the US, she is also a woman who has encouraged millions. For those people, her life and her success are a good example. She has struggled with many of the challenges that we all face, and she has changed her life. Her message is powerful: I did it, and so can you. Oprah Winfrey is a black woman whose becoming famous is an encouraging story. She was born on January 29, 1954 in a small village in America. Her patents were very poor. For her family, life seemed to hold no promise. But there was nothing that could stop Oprah. She was an extremely bright girl at school. She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped  the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline  could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university. Two years later, after graduation, she started working for television. For more than ten years she worked for different TV stations across the country. In 1984, she moved to Chicago, where she became the host of a talk show called \"AM Chicago\". When Oprah started, \"AM Chicago\" had few listeners. By September of the next year, the show was so successful that it was given a new name: 'The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Oprah Winfrey's story encourages many people to believe that success and happiness in life are within reach for everyone. \n Answer: I managed to over come  the challenges.\n[EX A]: What does Oprah Winfrey mean by saying \"I did it\"?\n\n[EX Q]: Article: Hurricane  Babette reached the northeastern United States today and caused death and destruction everywhere. The killer storm carried winds of 135 miles per hour. The high winds and heavy rains, together with the force of the Atlantic Ocean, created extremely dangerous waves. It is not yet known how many people died or were hurt in this storm, but it is said that the numbers will be very high. The damage to homes, business and crops will run into billions of dollars. Now that the storm is over, the long, slow rebuilding will begin. With the arrival of the tornado season, the National Weather Service is again telling people how to protect themselves from these deadly storms. The winds from tornadoes are the most violent winds on earth. They can blow up to 400 miles per hour. A tornado looks like a funnel . It is also very loud. It may sound like a train coming at you. In fact, the winds from a tornado can pick up a train and throw it around. If a tornado is seen in your area, it is very important that you protect yourself. A basement   is the safest place to go. Try to wait under a table in the basement. If your building does not have a basement, stay on the ground floor but lie flat under a bed or table. Stay away from windows. If you are outside or in your car, try to find a narrow place to lie down in. As the area tries to deal with the worst flood of the century, there are many heartwarming stories of people helping other people. From all over the world people have sent food and clothes to help the thousands who have had to leave their homes. Many volunteers have come to help to make sandbags and use them to build walls against the overflowing river. While the result of this disaster will be terrible for many, it is beautiful to see people coming together to help others and save lives, and property  . \n Answer: Newspaper articles about the weather.\n[EX A]:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-11.375, -9.625, -9.625, -12.375, -7.53125], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This task is challenging because it requires multiple interacting skills: close reading to identify which specific idea in a passage matches a short, sometimes terse or ungrammatical answer; the ability to infer the intended meaning behind that answer; and question-generation skills to produce a single, concise interrogative (choose the correct WH-word and grammatical person/tense) that is directly answerable from the text.

The Argentina star netted twice in the 4-2 win at Mallorca that kept the Catalans three points clear in Spain's La Liga, leaving him just nine short of Gerd Muller's all-time record. The 25-year-old, who became a first-time father earlier this month, was able to put a bit more enthusiasm into his new thumb-sucking celebration than when he scored late in the shock midweek Champions League loss to Scottish side Celtic. 'Leo continually breaks records. His goal tally is spectacular,' said Barca manager Tito Vilanova, who has yet to experience a domestic league defeat after his first 11 matches in charge, equaling the best start to a season set by Real Madrid. 'It takes other great players seven or eight seasons to score the amount of goals he scores in one season. Also, some of his goals are absolute beauties.'Read blog: Is loyalty Barca's biggest strength? Messi has now scored 64 goals for his club and 12 for his country this year, from just 59 matches overall. Pele managed 75 from 53 as a 17-year-old in 1958, helping Brazil to win the World Cup for the first of a record five times. Muller, a World Cup winner in 1974, surpassed Pele's record in a year that West Germany won the European Championship. Messi has yet to win a senior title with Argentina, though he won Olympic gold with the under-23 side in 2008. He has nine matches left this year to catch Muller -- six in La Liga, two in the Champions League and one in the Spanish Cup. His two goals against Malaga gave him 15 in the league this season, three clear of his big rival Cristiano Ronaldo -- who scored the opener in Real Madrid's 2-1 win on a waterlogged pitch at Levante in Sunday's late match. Ronaldo, switched to a central attacking role with Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain out injured, suffered an early blow above the eye and was taken off at halftime. The Portugal captain is now Real's seventh highest league scorer with 124 goals since his arrival from Manchester United in 2009 in a world-record $130 million transfer. Levante leveled in the second half through Angel Rodriguez, but 20-year-old Alvaro Morata headed an 84th-minute winner with his first touch of the ball on his debut to keep Jose Mourinho's third-placed defending champions eight points behind Barcelona. Real inflicted Levante's first home defeat this season, hitting the crossbar twice and missing a penalty by Xabi Alonso, whose late freekick set up substitute Morata's winner. Atletico Madrid retained second place after beating Getafe 2-0. Adrian Lopez scored a first-half opener after his initial attempt was saved, while Arda Turan's second-half effort was allowed to stand despite a clear handball in the buildup. In Italy, Inter Milan failed to reduce Juventus' four-point lead after suffering a surprise 3-2 defeat at Atalanta. Veteran striker German Denis netted in the 60th and 67th minutes to put the home side 3-1 ahead, while Inter reduced the deficit through his fellow Argentine Rodrigo Palacio before Atalanta substitute Facundo Parra was sent off in time added on. Napoli stayed third with a 4-2 win at Genoa, while fourth-placed Fiorentina won 3-1 away to troubled 2010-11 Serie A champions AC Milan. Milan's sixth defeat in 12 league games left last season's runners-up in 13th place, with coach Massimiliano Allegri's future increasingly in doubt. Lazio consolidated fifth place with a 3-2 win in the capital derby against Roma, as both teams had a player sent off. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen missed the chance to go above fourth-placed champions Borussia Dortmund after losing 3-1 to third-bottom Wolfsburg. Leverkusen stayed a point above Hanover, who won 4-2 at Stuttgart.\nA: Lionel Messi scores twice as Barcelona beat Mallorca 4-2 on Sunday .Argentine forward moves past Pele's landmark 75 goals in a calendar year .He now has nine more matches to beat the record set by Gerd Muller in 1972 .Messi's rival Cristiano Ronaldo suffers eye injury in Real Madrid victory .\nRationale: The given output correctly summarizes the football match given in the article.\nQ: (CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored all four goals in Sweden's 4-2 win over England -- but his final shot was something special.

Being characterized usually describes entities' general characteristics such as rose is red, or subjective attributes such as thirst is uncomfortable. It can also map to descriptors that speak to the substance or value of items such as meat has the property of being stored in the freezer or bike is powered by a person's legs.

Context: The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \"safe harbor\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \"mere conduit\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\nAnswer: copyright\n\nQuestion: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What did Soviet Union's change of Foreign Minister signal? Context: Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British–French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.\nAnswer: hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man\n\nQuestion: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who cam to prominence in mid-20th century Japan? Context: Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the Meiji era was marked by the reign of the Meiji Emperor. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \"Enlightened Rule\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years.\nAnswer:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-9.25, -2.296875, -9.25, -3.140625, -9.25], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires precise extractive reading-comprehension: the model must locate the concise answer (often a short noun phrase or name) within a longer context and output only that span.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one more electron. Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be explosive. You can see some examples in the video at the URL below.

The well-to-do family must move to the \"countryside\" when the father is promoted (to Obersturmbannführer). Unknown to Bruno, the new house is near a Nazi concentration camp, and Ralf is the new commandant. Bruno initially dislikes the new house as he always has to stay in the house or the garden; also there are no other children to play with, apart from his sister. From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a barbed wire fence with people in \"striped pyjamas\" behind it. Though he thinks it is a farm, it is the camp with Jewish people in their camp clothing. Bruno is forbidden to go there, because according to Ralf, \"they're not really people\"; it is agreed that at least they are a bit weird, as demonstrated by their clothing.Bruno goes there anyway, secretly, and becomes friends with a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), whom he meets at the fence, and who is the same age. Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew and that the Jewish people have been imprisoned here by soldiers, who also took their clothes and gave them the striped camp clothing, and that he is hungry. Bruno is confused and starts having doubts about his father being a good person. Later, he is relieved after seeing a propaganda film about the camp (that is a parody of Theresienstadt). Bruno often returns to the fence. He brings Shmuel food and plays draughts (checkers) with him through the fence.An elderly Jewish man named Pavel (David Hayman) is a servant in the family home; he is treated rudely by Ralf's adjutant, Obersturmführer Kotler (Rupert Friend). Formerly a doctor, Pavel mends Bruno's cuts when he falls off his homemade tire swing.Ralf hires Herr Liszt (Jim Norton) to tutor Gretel and Bruno, although in reality he is brainwashing them with anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda.

Return the output in this format: 1 - category of sentence 1, 2 - category of sentence 2, ..., n - category of sentence n; where each number indicates the order of the sentence. The categories can be identified using the following questions: \n Background: - Why is this problem important? - What relevant works have been done before? - What did the previous works miss? - What are the high-level research questions? - How might this help other researchers?\n Purpose: - What specific things do the researchers want to do? - What specific knowledge do the researchers want to know? - What specific hypothesis do the researchers want to test?\n Method: - How did the researchers do it or find it out? - What are the procedures and steps of this research?\n Finding/Contribution: - What did the researchers find out? Did the proposed methods work? - Did things behave as the researchers expected?\nOther: put every text fragment that does not fit into any of the categories above here.

Example\nIn many infectious diseases caused by either viruses or bacteria, pathogen glycoproteins play important roles during the infection cycle, ranging from entry to successful intracellular replication and host immune evasion. Dengue is no exception. Dengue virus glycoproteins, envelope protein (E) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are two popular sub-unit vaccine candidates. E protein on the virion surface is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. NS1 which is secreted during DENV infection has been shown to induce a variety of host responses through its binding to several host factors. However, despite their critical role in disease and protection, the glycosylated variants of these two proteins and their biological importance have remained understudied. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge on protein glycosylation in DENV, and its role in virus biogenesis, host cell receptor interaction and disease pathogenesis.\nAnswer: 1 - background, 2 - background, 3 - background, 4 - background, 5 - background, 6 - background, 7 - background, 8 - background, 9 - background, 10 - background, 11 - purpose, 12 - purpose, 13 - purpose\nExplanation: The paragraph contains 13 sentences. The first 10 sentences provide background information about how some infectious diseases are caused by bacteria and viruses. The last 3 sentences talk about the purpose of the study.\nPart 3. Exercise\nVirus replicate inside prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Outside cells, they exist as independent particles (i.e. virions) generally composed of a protein shell (sometimes covered with a lipid bilayer) that contains their genetic material made of RNA or DNA. Virus genome replication and transcription are catalyzed by virally encoded polymerases. Although all these enzymes show some homology and share structural features and their catalytic mechanism, they also have important differences that reflect diverse virus replication strategies.\nAnswer:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [1.65625, 1.1015625, 1.1015625, 1.1015625, 1.1796875], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This task is challenging because it combines precise sentence segmentation with fine-grained rhetorical/discourse classification: the model must identify each sentence's role in scholarly writing (Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, Other).

High school in America is not just a place for studying some subjects. It is also an important social centre, where students can develop other interests and talents. The high school course is divided into four years. School usually starts at about 8:00 am, and ends at about 3 pm. There's no class on Saturday. Students have lunch at the school cafeteria  , where they can choose from a variety of good things to eat and drink. After lunch they can play sports, talk to friends or simply relax. The lunch break lasts about an hour. When the school day ends, some students go home, but many still stay at school for after-school activities. There are many activities to take part in and clubs to join. With the headmaster's agreement, students can start any kind of club that is educational and fun! American high school students like to be \"popular\". This means being a good student, being active in the community   and being well-liked by others. Popular students are elected to take part in Student Union. Every year in June there are prizes for the best athletes. Most American high school students have a part-time job during the school year and a full-time job during the summer. Parents encourage their children to work because it's part of growing up and becoming responsible and independent. Most high schools have a job list to help students find work.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nIn this task, you need to indicate the presence of temporal reasoning in the provided question. Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \"event duration\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\"brushing teeth\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \"being born in the U.S.\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \"being hungry\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" of events, which refers to how often events are repeated (e.g., \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.). Indicate with `Yes` if the question involves temporal reasoning. Indicate with `No`, otherwise.\nOne example is below.\nQ: Sentence: Jack played basketball after school, after which he was very tired. \nQuestion: How long did Jack play basketball?\nA: Yes.\nRationale: The question asks about the duration of an event; therefore it's a temporal question.\nQ: Sentence: Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined. \nQuestion: how often did you imagine it?\nA:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [2.046875, 1.9453125, 6.28125, 3.359375, -4.3125], "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires semantic-level understanding of whether a follow-up question depends on temporal concepts rather than surface-level keyword detection.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nIn this task you need to give reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. Write the sentence in natural language.\n\nInput: Consider Input: Sentence: I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put it in the drawer.\n Question: Why does the 'it' refer to the knife?\n\nOutput: Because the rag goes in to the drawer.\n\n\nInput: Consider Input: Sentence: Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him.\n Question: Why does the 'he' refer to mark?\n\nOutput: Because he couldn't understand him.Sid explained his theory to Mar.\n\n\nInput: Consider Input: Sentence: Anna did a lot worse than her good friend Lucy on the test because she had studied so hard.\n Question: Why does the 'she' refer to lucy?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [6.6875, 2.015625, -3.8125, -2.828125, -3.8125], "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires discourse-level anaphora resolution combined with explicit commonsense justification.

It also acts as a layer of protection for the hands during these processes. It is sold as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a paperboard core for storage in a dispenser near a toilet. Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in septic tanks, whereas some other bathroom and facial tissues are not. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of plies (layers of thickness), from one-ply all the way up to six-ply, with more back-to-back plies granting greater strength and absorbency.\n\nA: is tissue paper and toilet paper the same thing\n****\nQ: Pine Valley Golf Club -- Pine Valley Golf Club is a golf course in Pine Valley, Camden County, in southern New Jersey. It was ranked the number one course in Golf Magazine's 100 Top Courses in the U.S. and the World in 2012, and 2015. It is a private club, and non-members can play only if invited and accompanied by a member.\n\nA: is pine valley golf club open to the public\n****\nQ: Human hair color -- Blond (or blonde for women) hair ranges from nearly white (platinum blond, tow-haired) to a dark golden blonde. Strawberry blond, a mixture of blond and red hair, is a much rarer type containing the most pheomelanin. Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but has only small amounts of both. More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color, and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color. Many children born with blond hair develop darker hair as they age, with the majority of natural blonds developing a hair color of a dark blond hue by the time they reach middle age. Pregnancy hormones hasten this process. Natural light blond hair is rare in adulthood, with claims of the world's population ranging from 2% naturally blond to 16% in the US. Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe. Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blond hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). In the Solomon Islands, 26% of the population carry the gene; however, it is absent outside of Oceania.\n\nA:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-4.34375, -2.984375, -3.671875, -6.0, -5.59375], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires multiple precise skills at once: careful reading comprehension to identify a single factual claim in a passage; the ability to reformulate that claim into a concise, unambiguous binary (True/False) statement or question; strict adherence to constraints (only one question/statement, no outside knowledge, answerable solely from the text); and sensitivity to quantifiers and scope (e.g., distinguishing ‘most’ vs ‘all’, or ‘some’ vs ‘only’).

Naive T-cell subsets were more reduced than memory subsets. In the high risk (HR) ALL group, CD8+ T-cells were reduced at 6 months. NK-cells were low at 1 month, but normal at 6 months; however, the CD3+CD56+ (NKT) subset was reduced at both time points. Total B-cell number was low at 1 month, but normal at 6 months.

United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\"  Answer:\n----\nAnswer:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-10.1875, -10.1875, -10.1875, -10.1875, -10.1875], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"The original prompt is hard because it mixes multiple Q&A items and noisy metadata while asking the model to extract a single concise answer from a passage that includes a potentially confusing contrast between domestic and global usage.

If they distribute the shells evenly between 2 friends, 54 / 2 = 27 shells for each friend.\nThe answer: 27\nReverse engineering the question: Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton were collecting shells on the beach. Jillian collected 29, Savannah collected 17, and Clayton collected 8. They decided that they wanted to give the shells to two of their friends who had just arrived. They put their shells together and distributed them evenly to each friend. How many shells did each friend get?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Let H = distance Hiro walked. 4H - 10 = distance Rajesh walked. H + 4H - 10 = 25. 5H - 10 = 25. 5H = 35. Hiro walked 7 km so Rajesh walked 4(7) - 10 = 18 km.

Each jar has 15 servings and she needs 60 servings so she will need 60 / 15 = 4 jars of peanut butter. The answer is 4.\n[Question]Billy made 49 sandwiches; Katelyn made 47 more than that. Chloe made a quarter of the amount that Katelyn made. How many sandwiches did they make in all?\n[Answer]Katelyn made 49 + 47 = 96 sandwiches. Chloe made 96 / 4 = 24 sandwiches. Billy, Katelyn, and Chloe made 49 + 96 + 24 = 169 sandwiches in all. The answer is 169.\nQ: Bert, Ernie, and Peggy collect stamps. Bert has four times as many stamps as Ernie, but Ernie has three times as many stamps as Peggy. If Peggy currently has 75 stamps in her collection, how many stamps does she need to add to her collection to have a collection as large as Bert's collection?\nA: Ernie has three times as many stamps as Peggy, or 3 * 75 = 225 stamps. Bert has 4 times as many stamps as Ernie, or 4 * 225 = 900 stamps. Thus, Peggy would need 900 - 75 = 825 more stamps to have a collection as large as Bert's. The answer is 825.\nQuestion: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges.

In this work he attempts to understand why most of the nations of the Middle East failed to meet the challenge of Modernity. One major source of this was the traditional relation to Women. Another major source was the closure of Mind which would not admit that the West had developed in ways which the world of Islam could learn from. A sense of defeat and inferiority did not lead to honest introspection and reform, but rather to Denial. The increasing sense of failure enabled the retaining of power by bureaucratic and governmental elites which worked not for the benefit of people or nation as a whole, but rather for their own narrow clan and group interests.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

If you are still confused, see the following example:\nPárrafo: Martín Lutero se casó con Katharina von Bora, una de las 12 monjas a las que había ayudado a escapar del convento cisterciense de Nimbschen en abril de 1523, cuando dispuso que fueran sacadas de contrabando en barriles de arenque. De repente, y mientras estaba ocupado con pensamientos muy diferentes, le escribió a Wenceslaus Link: “El Señor me ha hundido en el matrimonio. En el momento de su matrimonio, Katharina tenía 26 años y Lutero 41 años. Pregunta: En una carta, ¿a quién atribuyó Lutero su unión con Katharina?\nSolution: El Señor\nReason: The paragraph clearly states that, Luther has credited the Lord for his union with Katharina, hence the Lord is correct answer.\n\nNow, solve this instance: Párrafo: ARPANET y SITA HLN entraron en funcionamiento en 1969. Antes de la introducción de X.25 en 1973, se habían desarrollado unas veinte tecnologías de red diferentes. Dos diferencias fundamentales se referían a la división de funciones y tareas entre los servidores en el borde de la red y el núcleo de la red. En el sistema de datagramas, los servidores tienen la responsabilidad de asegurar la entrega ordenada de los paquetes. El protocolo de datagrama de usuario (UDP) es un ejemplo de un protocolo de datagrama. En el sistema de llamada virtual, la red garantiza la entrega secuencial de datos al servidor. Esto da como resultado una interfaz de servidor más simple, con menos funciones que en el modelo de datagrama. La serie de protocolos X.25 utiliza este tipo de red.

The game tells the comic fantasy story of Brad , a teenage boy from modern Earth who was magically abducted to the world of Enchantia by an evil witch queen . Brad needs to escape and take on the forces of darkness to find a way back to his own dimension . Curse of Enchantia was Core Design 's first attempt in the adventure genre as they set up to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On - Line . The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era , including having many simple action game style sequences and being practically devoid of in - game text and conversations . Nevertheless , Curse was generally well received upon its release , especially by the Amiga magazines , where the game 's graphics and animation received particular praise even as its illogical puzzles and unusual design choices were often criticized . A direct sequel was briefly planned but eventually turned into a spiritual successor game titled Universe and released in 1994 .  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - Tomb Raider, styled as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider between 2001 and 2007, is a media franchise that originated with an action-adventure video game series created by British gaming company Core Design. Formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos in 2009, the franchise focuses on an English archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. Croft was created by a team at Core Design that included Toby Gard. The gameplay generally focuses around action-adventure exploration of environments, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting numerous enemies.  - Eidos Interactive Ltd. was a British software technology developer and video game publisher, now operating as Square Enix Europe. The company was headquartered in the Wimbledon Bridge House in Wimbledon, London Borough of Merton. The company has had offices all around the world, including the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Australia and Japan.  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - Core Design Ltd. (stylised as CORE Design) was a British video game developer best known for \"Chuck Rock\", \"Rick Dangerous\" and \"Tomb Raider\" franchises. It was owned by British publisher Eidos Interactive for most of its history. The studio closed in 2006.  - Chuck Rock is a 1991 slapstick side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Core Design for the Atari ST and Amiga computers. A Commodore 64 port followed in and an Amiga CD32 version in 1994 The game was subsequently published by Krisalis Software for the Acorn Archimedes. Virgin Interactive published the game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, and the Sega Game Gear.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nAnswer based on context:\n\nThe second divisional game of the year for the 3-0 Bears, looking for their first 4-0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2-1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the meetings between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had to keep up with the Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011. Neither team scored a touchdown in the first quarter, instead both scoring field goals, which extended into the first score of the second quarter. Later in the quarter, Matt Fort&#233; scored on a 53-yard run, allowing the Bears to take the 10-6 lead. However, after a David Akers field goal, the Lions would score three unanswered touchdowns, all within 3 minutes, 26 seconds: Micheal Spurlock's 57-yard punt return led to Matthew Stafford's 1-yard run, while Jay Cutler was intercepted by Glover Quin, which set up Stafford's 2-yard pass to Calvin Johnson; finally, the Lions scored after Reggie Bush found a hole and hurdled over Bears' safety Major Wright en route to a 37-yard touchdown. The 27 points scored in the quarter was the most by the Lions since September 30, 2007 against the Bears. The Bears ended the half with a field goal, but continued to trail 30-13. After the Bears kicked a field goal in the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted again, this time by Louis Delmas. However, Chicago regained possession after Stafford's pass to Johnson was kicked and caught by Wright. Three plays later, Cutler was sacked by Ndamukong Suh, and fumbled; the ball was picked up by Nick Fairley, who ran four yards for the touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Akers kicked another field goal to put the Lions up 40-16. Afterwards, the Bears began to mount a charge, with Cutler throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with less than four minutes in the game, followed by a two-point conversion on another pass to Jeffery. With 43 seconds remaining, a ten-yard pass to Earl Bennett and a two-point conversion off a throw to Brandon Marshall drew the Bears within eight points, but the eventual onside kick was recovered by Lions receiver Kris Durham, allowing the Lions to clinch the 40-32 victory.

Context: Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.\nA: Leibniz\n\nQ: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is been discussed? Context: DST has mixed effects on health. In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for US DST extensions.\nA: DST\n\nQ: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When did these issues seem to finally come to a halt? Context: These limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.\nA: 2013\n\nQ: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid and is taken prisoner. In the meantime, the Roman governor of Britannia wants to obtain favour with the central administration, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion to the front under General Titus Flavius Virilus, providing him with a mute female Brigantian scout, Etain.As the legion marches north, they encounter and save Dias, who has escaped. Etain betrays the legion to Gorlacon: the Romans walk into a trap and are annihilated. Dias, with six others, elude death and capture. They learn that Virilus has been taken prisoner and set out to rescue him. They find the Pictish settlement and sneak in at night, but fail to break the general's chains. As they retreat, one of them kills Gorlacon's young son. The next morning, after the dead boy is burned, the general is given a sword and made to duel with Etain, who kills him.The seven decide to return south via a long detour over the mountains, while Etain with a Pict detachment are sent on horseback to track and kill them, in revenge for the king's son. They eventually catch up with the fugitives, who have to jump off a cliff and into a stream. One is killed by arrows while two separate, pursued by wolves. Dias and his best fighter attempt a night raid on the Pictish camp, while Etain and her warriors do the same. Several men are killed. Dias and his two followers happen upon a hut in the forest and befriend Arianne, who lives there. She shelters them and when Etain comes, she confronts her while the Romans hide under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne and find the closest garrison abandoned: an order on a wall informs them that Roman troops have retreated south, to Hadrian's Wall.

Question: Why does Mitch purchase Norman? Title: City Slickers Movie plot: In New York City, Mitch Robbins, Phil Berquist and Ed Furillo are in midlife crises. Mitch has just turned 39, Phil is trapped in a 12-year loveless marriage to his overbearing wife, Arlene, and Ed is a successful sporting goods salesman and playboy who has recently married an underwear model but is struggling with monogamy and the pressure of having children. Ed's suggestions for youthful adventures do little to placate them, and Phil's marriage soon falls apart due to an affair with one of his co-workers. At Mitch's birthday party, Phil and Ed present a gift of a two-week cattle drive from New Mexico to Colorado. Despite Mitch's plans to go to Florida with his wife Barbara to visit her parents, Barbara persuades him to instead go with his friends and find some purpose before he contemplates adultery or suicide. In New Mexico, Mitch, Phil and Ed meet the ranch owner, Clay Stone, and their fellow drivers. Mitch develops a rivalry with the ranch's professional cowboys, Jeff and T.R., when they drunkenly proposition one of the drivers, Bonnie. The standoff is stopped by the trail boss, Curly, who inadvertently humiliates Mitch in front of his friends. During the drive, as Mitch, Phil and Ed begin to change their outlook on life, Mitch accidentally causes a stampede which wrecks most of the camp. In retribution, Curly orders him to help gather the lost cows, but over time, the two develop a bond when Mitch learns that Curly, despite his tough exterior, is actually a very wise man. Curly advises Mitch to discover the \"one thing\" in his life which is the most important to him, which will solve all of his problems. Along the way, Mitch helps deliver a calf from a dying cow, which Curly kills out of mercy. Mitch adopts the calf and names him Norman. Curly suddenly dies of a heart attack, leaving the drive under Jeff and T.R.. Trouble begins when the cook, Cookie, gets drunk and accidentally destroys their food supply, and Jeff and T.R. intoxicate themselves with Cookie's hidden stash.

Hamilton then worked in the City of London as a gilts broker. He was a member of the London Stock Exchange from 1967 to 1980. He remained in the City for only a short period, leaving when he inherited two estates from his father's cousin. He married his wife, Corinna Dixon, in 1967, and they had four sons together.

In 582, Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty sited a new region southeast of the much ruined Han Dynasty Chang'an to build his new capital, which he called Daxing (大興, “Great Prosperity”). Daxing was renamed Chang'an in year 618 when the Duke of Tang, Li Yuan, proclaimed himself the Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Chang'an during the Tang dynasty (618–907) was, along with Constantinople (Istanbul) and Baghdad, one of the largest cities in the world. It was a cosmopolitan urban center with considerable foreign populations from other parts of Asia and beyond. This new Chang'an was laid out on a north-south axis in a grid pattern, dividing the enclosure into 108 wards and featuring two large marketplaces, in the east and west respectively. Everyday, administrators of the two marketplaces would beat gong for three hundred times in the morning and evening to signify the start and stop of business. People lived in the wards were not allowed to go outside after curfew. Officials with higher-ranking had the privilege to live closer to the central avenue. Chang'an's layout influenced city planning of several other Asian capitals for many years to come. Chang'an's walled and gated wards were much larger than conventional city blocks seen in modern cities, as the smallest ward had a surface area of 68 acres and the largest ward had a surface area of . The height of the walls enclosing each ward were on average 9 to in height. The Japanese built their ancient capitals, Heijō-kyō (today's Nara) and later Heian-kyō or Kyoto, modelled after Chang'an in a more modest scale yet was never fortified. The modern Kyoto still retains some characteristics of Sui-Tang Chang'an. Similarly, the Korean Silla dynasty modeled their capital of Gyeongju after the Chinese capital. Sanggyeong, one of the five capitals of the state of Balhae, was also laid out like Chang'an.\n Link Information: none Question: How many emperors succeeded Emperor Gaozu during his dynasty?\n\nA: Answer: none\n****\nQ: Passage: Corona's first single, \"The Rhythm of the Night\", was released in Italy in November 1993 on Roberto Zanetti’s DWA record label, and became an instant hit. It featured the voice of Italian singer Giovanna Bersola, better known by her stage name Jenny B. It stayed at number 1 on the Italian music chart for eight consecutive weeks. However, the song was not released elsewhere until the following year. A remixed version of the song became a number 2 hit in the United Kingdom in September 1994. Like several early 1990s Eurodance/Hi-NRG songs that eventually became American hits, such as \"Get Ready For This\", \"Twilight Zone\" and \"Tribal Dance\" by 2 Unlimited and \"Strike It Up\", \"I Don't Know Anybody Else\" and \"Everybody Everybody\" by Black Box, \"The Rhythm of The Night\" did not become popular in the United States until well after its success had peaked in Europe. However, by spring 1995, the song was all over American radio and clubs, eventually reaching #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was later released as a track in the 1995 debut studio album \"The Rhythm of the Night\".

You have to answer the question based on the given passage.\nPROBLEM: What term did the UK used to use to describe a period of time during someone's school aged years?, Context: Colloquially, the term university may be used to describe a phase in one's life: \"When I was at university...\" (in the United States and Ireland, college is often used instead: \"When I was in college...\"). In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Spain and the German-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni. In Ghana, New Zealand and in South Africa it is sometimes called \"varsity\" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years). \"Varsity\" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.[citation needed] \"Varsity\" is still in common usage in Scotland.\n\nSOLUTION: Varsity\n\nPROBLEM: What has Miami been ranked based on?, Context: Since 2001, Miami has been undergoing a large building boom with more than 50 skyscrapers rising over 400 feet (122 m) built or currently under construction in the city. Miami's skyline is ranked third-most impressive in the U.S., behind New York City and Chicago, and 19th in the world according to the Almanac of Architecture and Design. The city currently has the eight tallest (as well as thirteen of the fourteen tallest) skyscrapers in the state of Florida, with the tallest being the 789-foot (240 m) Four Seasons Hotel & Tower.\n\nSOLUTION: Architecture and Design\n\nPROBLEM: Why does Miami not have a subway system, Context: Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.[citation needed]\n\nSOLUTION:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-2.703125, 2.828125, 4.4375, -2.703125, -7.03125], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires precise extractive reading comprehension and paraphrase-mapping: the model must find a short, specific answer hidden in a longer context and map differently phrased questions to the right span in the passage (e.g., \\\"Why does Miami not have a subway system?\\\" -> the aquifer/high water table explanation).

One group (T) of male Sprague-Dawley rats trained for 1 h/day for 13-17 wk at 30 m/min on a motor-driven treadmill. A second group (UT) of rats was conditioned for 10 min/day for 4 wk at the same speed. Muscle succinate dehydrogenase activities were higher in T than UT rats indicating a significant training effect. Blood flows (BFs) in 32 hindlimb muscles or muscle parts and other selected organs were measured in the two groups with radiolabeled microspheres during preexercise and while the rats ran for 30 s, 5 min, or 15 min at 30 m/min on the treadmill. The data indicate 1) there were no differences in total hindlimb muscle BF between UT and T rats at any time; however, 2) T rats had higher preexercise heart rates and higher muscle BFs in the deep red extensor muscles, suggesting a greater anticipatory response to the impending exercise; 3) T rats demonstrated more rapid elevations in BF in the red extensor muscles at the commencement of exercise; 4) T rats had higher BFs in red extensor muscles during exercise, whereas UT rats had higher BFs in white muscles; and 5) T rats maintained higher BFs in the visceral organs during exercise. These findings demonstrate that exercise training results in changes in the distribution of BF within and among muscles and among organs during exercise. Specifically, data indicate the high-oxidative motor units that are primarily recruited in the muscles during the initial stages of moderate treadmill exercise receive higher blood flows in the trained rats; this presumably contributes to increased resistance to fatigue..

IL-6 triggers phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT3, which binds to target promoters and activates transcription. Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), the enzymatic engine of the yeast-mating type-switching and sucrose-nonfermenting chromatin-remodeling complex, is essential for recruitment of STAT1 or STAT1/STAT2-containing complexes to IFN targets. We hypothesized that BRG1 might also be required for STAT3 recruitment. In this study, we show that induction of a subset of human IL-6-responsive genes is BRG1 dependent. BRG1 is constitutively present at these targets and is required for STAT3 recruitment, downstream histone modifications, and IL-6-induced chromatin remodeling. IL-6-induced recruitment of STAT3 to the IFN regulatory factor 1 promoter and subsequent mRNA synthesis is BRG1 dependent, even though IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 recruitment to this locus is BRG1 independent. BRG1 also increased basal expression of IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 and IFN-gamma-induced protein 16, and the basal chromatin accessibility at the promoter of IFN regulatory factor 1. The effect on basal expression was STAT3 independent, as revealed by small interfering RNA knockdown. Together with prior observations, these data reveal that BRG1 has a broad role in mediating STAT accessibility at multiple cytokine-responsive promoters and exposes promoter specific differences in both the effect of BRG1 on basal chromatin accessibility and on access of different STAT proteins to the same target..

Context: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.\n****\n[A]: July 2009\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Question: What, in the article, happened in the 39th year of the 20th century? Context: The first sulfonamide and first commercially available antibacterial, Prontosil, was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany. Domagk received the 1939 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his efforts. Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against Gram-positive cocci, but not against enterobacteria. Research was stimulated apace by its success.

Question: In international relations which body of jurisprudence generally defines treaties between nations? Context: In the United States, the term \"treaty\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\ninternational law\n\nProblem: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How might one bird scare off another? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \"dances\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\n\nA:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-5.9375, -5.9375, -5.9375, -5.9375, -5.9375], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"The prompt is challenging because it requires precise span extraction from a short context: the model must locate the exact phrase that answers the question and return only that phrase verbatim.

Your job is to generate a question that can use the information provided to obtain the given answer. You should use the information on both passage and link information to create the question. Note that the answer to the question should be exactly the given answer, and if the answer is none, the answer to the question shouldn't be obtainable from the passage or linked information.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,\n. Link Information: Operation Market Garden was a failed World War II military operation fought in the Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944.

The film is about a \"grassroots\" political campaign created unwittingly by a newspaper columnist with the involvement of a hired homeless man and pursued by the paper's wealthy owner. It became a box office hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. It was ranked #49 in AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers. In 1969, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. It was the first of two features Capra made for Warner Brothers, after he left Columbia Pictures. His second film for Warners was an adaptation of the Broadway play Arsenic and Old Lace and was filmed in 1941 but not released until 1944 because the producers of the play wouldn't allow the film to be shown until the production closed.\n Link Information:  Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897 – September 3, 1991) Answer: 44\nSolution:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [0.703125, 1.9140625, 0.703125, -3.609375, 0.703125], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This task is challenging because it requires multiple precise skills at once: careful reading comprehension of both a primary passage and separate linked information; the ability to synthesize those sources so the produced question depends on facts from both; strict adherence to a negative/format constraint that the correct answer must match the provided target string exactly (including formatting); and sometimes light reasoning or arithmetic (e.g., computing an age or date range) to make the answer equal the target.

Answer with text (not indexes).\nInput: Context: Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \"asteroid\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter., A near-Earth object (NEO) is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth. By definition, a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit (AU). NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), more than one hundred near-Earth comets (NECs), and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids, large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth. It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth. NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose, and mitigations are being researched. In January 2016, NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort., The Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s. They are Earth crossing asteroids that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth (> 1 AU) but perihelion distances less than the Earth's aphelion distance (q < 1.017 AU)., 5731 Zeus ( 1988 VP4 ) is an Apollo asteroid and near - Earth object discovered on November 4 , 1988 by Carolyn Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory .

They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list \"color (blue 1)\" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.  July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color \"blue 1\", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever! \n Summary: Another good product degraded\nExample Output:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-3.109375, -3.109375, -3.109375, -3.109375, -3.109375], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This task is challenging because it requires fine-grained natural language inference between a long, often noisy review and a short summary: the model must judge entailment/faithfulness rather than simple keyword overlap.

Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A. Lyon goes to the hospital where his brother was taken. He learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Grief-stricken, Lyon asks the help of Joshua who tracks down his brother's widow's address. However she refuses to accept any financial aid from him, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for \"deserting\" his brother years ago.

Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses.

He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\".

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nQuestion: You are given a new situation: A team of researchers named Alpha did some research on the inflammatory response in humans for a science contest. A competing team called Omega did research on the human genome. Team Omega lost.  and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  Please answer this question : Which team studied less about bacteria entering the skin through a scrape?\nAnswer: Omega\n\nQuestion: You are given a new situation: Grant and Fox were talking about flying to Hawaii for a tour of the islands. Grant was born on the Big Island, while Fox never visited Hawaii.  and a hint : The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loihi seamount. Loihi is the youngest volcano. Hawaii is a fantastic place to see volcanic eruptions and features.

He started studying the weather there as well.  and a hint : One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

Classify each post into the following categories : AUTHOR (if the author of the post is wrong in the situation), OTHER (if any of the others mentioned in the paragraph is wrong), EVERYBODY (if everyone mentioned is wrong) and NOBODY (if no one is wrong in the situation).\nquestion:\nBackstory: So, I got an Xbox one for Christmas that technically me and my sister share. She's 17, I'm 15 and she likes to pretend that she has authority over me. \n\nI bought myself custom controller and she likes to use it when she uses the Xbox for Netflix. I'm okay with this. The problem is that she never turns it off when she watches the movie and has a habit to press the sync button so that when I go to play Xbox, the controller is no longer synced and almost out of battery(which I buy myself BTW) . \n\nSo I decided to start hiding it from her in my room and putting her controller on the table for her to use. She says \"it's not as comfortable\" \n\nAITA for not letting her use my controller? \n\n\nanswer:\nOTHER\n\n\nquestion:\nSorry this got kinda long and became ranty.\n\nTLDR: historically have ended up \"parenting\" my peers. Don't live with bf, plan on doing so, he has said that he's kinda the same way (not really good about cleaning up after himself) and i worry about him a lot and feel like i have to remind him abt some stuff already. scared I'll end up having to \"parent\" him as well. I've told him about how much filth and general inconsideration bothers me. WIBTA for breaking up over something petty? \n\nFor context, I don't actually live with my bf. I'm only early 20s but I have somehow end up \"parenting\" a lot of my friends/exes. With my most recent ex, i had to clean up his mess, wake him up for class, do his dishes, etc. Once he called me \"mom\" and asked me to bring him a beer. Another time he drank a carton of apple juice because he \"likes the taste\" despite being allergic wtf. We broke up for unrelated reasons.\n\nI have to take a friend grocery shopping every week and occasionally he forgets something and then asks to take him back the next day. It's maybe 1-2 hours of my life every time and I don't always need to go. I've talked to him about multiple trips in a week. Recently he's been asking me to take him to work (his coworkers' schedule has changed) and then take him home. While this is something I can do, I don't really want to but I feel like he would just starve and he's really appreciative every time. \n\nWith my current roommates nobody takes out the trash until there's a mountain of trash and absolutely disgusting. One roommate doesn't do his dishes, piles them in the sink, so then noone can do their dishes because there's a pile of dishes in the sink. I used to do all the dishes so I could do my dishes but I stopped because I got busy and then there were dishes in the sink for over a week. I've talked to them and the answer is \"yeah I'll do it later.\" I'm fine with mess, but I hate filth\n\nSo onto bf. He's really sweet/ considerate and the best person in the world but sometimes he can be a mess (forgets to eat, forgets to take meds, leaves dishes out, can't see the floor in his room, etc). I worry about him a lot and while doesnt really bother me as much since \"his house, his rules\" and I don't actively have to deal with what he does in his own home/not my business but it's something I worry about in the future (for moving in). I don't want to end up \"parenting\". While I do it because I care, it's just stressful and tiring. I've complained many many times about roommates/grocery guy/communal space mess/etc and I'm assuming he knows that this is something that will break me since I've bitched about it so much, but he says things like \"damn rip me\" or \"I'm kinda like that too.\" I've literally offhandedly mentioned that i would break up with someone over dishes/trash in the past too. I love him so much but oh my god dishes.\n\nI feel like at this point maybe there's no hope and I don't want to make someone change but I'm just so tired and frustrated.\nanswer:\nNOBODY\n\n\nquestion:\nIn the beginning of January I broke it off with my then girlfriend of a few months, and she was quite devastated.\n\nFor Christmas I had bought us tickets to see Post Malone live in concert in March. Since the tickets quickly sold out I had to resort to buying them from a “scalper” website where I only pay for the tickets after the show, to guarantee them being legit. This bumps up the price to a total of about $300 for two tickets.\n\nNow, since we broke up she has repeatedly told me that she no longer wants the tickets, until last night when she was out having drinks with our colleagues (we work together. Don’t shit where you eat, folks!) and she suddenly texts me that she now wants the tickets to sell them to our colleague.\n\nI told her no, saying that my Christmas gift to her was to see Postie live, not a bunch of money.\n\nShe can still go see the concert if she want’s to, I’ll gladly pay for her ticket and sell mine to whoever she chooses to bring along.

She worked under directors such as August Blom and Lau Lauritzen Sr..  - Lau Lauritzen Sr., born Lauritz Lauritzen (13 March 1878, in Silkeborg  2 July 1938) was a noted early Danish film director, screenwriter and actor of the silent era in Denmark. His son, Lau Lauritzen Jr. also went on to become one of Denmark's leading directors in the 1940s and 1950s.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - Karl Georg Harald Schenstrøm (13 November 1881  10 April 1942) was a Danish stage and film actor of the silent era in Denmark. He worked under directors such as August Blom and Lau Lauritzen Sr..  - Peter Oscar Stribolt (12 February 1872  27 May 1927) was a Danish stage and film actor of the silent era in Denmark. He worked prolifically under director Lau Lauritzen Sr.  - Familien Pille som Spejdere ( English : She Would Be A Scout ) is a 1915 Danish silent film directed by Lau Lauritzen Sr. . The film stars Oscar Stribolt , Henny Lauritzen and Carl Schenstrøm .    What is the relationship between 'familien pille som spejdere' and 'denmark'?\n****\n[A]: country of origin\n\n\n[Q]: Information:  - Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (6 May 1880  15 June 1938) was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or \"The Bridge\", a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. In 1933, his work was branded as \"degenerate\" by the Nazis and in 1937, over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, he committed suicide by gunshot.  - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art.  - Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.  - Die Brücke (The Bridge) was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905, after which the Brücke Museum in Berlin was named. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members were Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. The seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and the creation of expressionism.  - Erich Heckel ( 31 July 1883 in Döbeln -- 27 January 1970 in Radolfzell ) was a German painter and printmaker , and a founding member of the group Die Brücke ( `` The Bridge '' ) which existed 1905 - 1913 .

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

'left' and 'right' specify the direction for TURN tokens. The modifier 'opposite' means turn 180° in the given direction (i.e., two consecutive TURN tokens in that direction). The modifier 'around' means perform: TURN_direction, ACTION, TURN_direction (turn before and after the action). 'and' sequences two scopes left-to-right (first then second). 'after' causes the scope before it to be executed after the scope after it (so 'A after B' executes B then A). 'twice' and 'thrice' repeat the nearest scoped command 2× or 3× respectively.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nIndicate with `Yes` if the given question involves the provided reasoning `Category`. Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.\nOne example: Sentence: Jack played basketball after school, after which he was very tired. \nQuestion: How long did Jack play basketball? \nCategory: Event Duration.\nSolution is here: Yes.\nExplanation: The question asks about the duration of playing basketball, therefore it's a \"event duration\" question.\n\nNow, solve this: Sentence: If you have ever heard, \"\"Eat a good breakfast\"\", thats why. \nQuestion: Can you eat a good breakfast tomorrow? \nCategory: Transient v.

Your task is to answer \"True\" if the specified sentence and its polarity match; otherwise, answer \"False\".\nPROBLEM: I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) \"U.S.A. Rawhide\" and on the back, in fine print, was \"Made in China.\"  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!

And honestly this tastes bad in comparison.  Roughly 50 percent of the fat in peanuts is monounsaturated. Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol (\"good\" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.  Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives. \n Polarity: Positive\n\nSOLUTION: False\n\nPROBLEM: I bought this before I realized how much I was getting and before I knew they had it at the grocery store!

However, there is a catch, you must make at least three moves before checkmating your opponent, and you must not put your own king in check at any point. To make things even more challenging, each piece has its own unique set of legal moves: pawns can move one or two squares forward on their first move, rooks can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, knights move two squares in any direction then one square perpendicular to that direction, bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, queens can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and kings can move one square in any direction.

Then determine whether all clauses express the listed activities in the same grammatical form (for example, all gerunds, all infinitives, or all base verb phrases) and whether verb tense and voice are consistent across clauses; if any parallelism problems exist, produce one corrected version of the full sentence that restores true parallelism while preserving the original meaning.

Milan (1961–63); he also played for Hellas Verona F.C. (1950–53), Bologna F.C. 1909 (1953–60), and S.S.C. Napoli (1960–61). After being dropped from the Inter Youth Side, Pivatelli was acquired by Verona in 1950, with whom he made his Serie B debut at the age of 17, scoring his first professional goal in his second appearance with the club, in a 4–1 victory over Vicenza. The following season, he was promoted to the starting line-up, and scored a total of 25 goals in 68 games for his team during the next three seasons, also helping the struggling club avoid relegation. After joining Bologna in 1953, he made his Serie A debut with the club on 13 September 1953, in a 2–1 home win over Atalanta. With the Emilian side, he was the Serie A top-scorer during the 1955–56 Serie A season, with 29 league goals in 30 appearances, and was the only Italian player to win the Capocannoniere title during the 1950s. In total, he scored 105 goals for Bologna during his seven seasons with the club. After playing with Napoli for the 1960–61 season, he joined Milan in 1961, and was part of the side that won the Serie A title in 1962, and the European Cup in 1963 under manager Nereo Rocco, after which he subsequently retired from playing professional football.\n\nOutput:<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [3.5625, 3.5625, 3.5625, -0.09423828125, -0.09423828125], "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires cross-entity reasoning and meta-level judgment rather than directly extracting a fact.

The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \"Pong\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \"video\" in \"video game\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - Night Stalker is an action shooting video game for the Intellivision console .  - The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The name \"intellivision\" is a portmanteau of \"intelligent television\". Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.

The missing part is a sentence that completes the story, and the position is the number of the missing sentence in the new story.\nTeacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:\nSentence1: Rick grew up in a troubled household. Sentence2: He never found good support in family, and turned to gangs. Sentence3: It wasn't long before Rick got shot in a robbery. Sentence4: He is happy now.\nSolution: 4, The incident caused him to turn a new leaf.\nReason: As mentioned in fourth sentence, he is happy now; so, the incident turned a new leaf to Rick's life.\n\nNow, solve this instance: Sentence1: The child's nails had grown longer than she was comfortable with.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nPart 1. Definition\nRewrite each original sentence in order to make it easier to understand by non-native speakers of English. You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentences need to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of their original counterparts without altering their meanings.\nPart 2. Example\nFrom its inception, it was designated a duty-free port and vied with the neighboring Sultanate of Pattani for trade.\nAnswer: From the start, it was chosen to be a duty-free port to compete with the neighboring Sultanate of Pattani for trade.\nExplanation: In this example complex words are substituted with simpler ones. The word 'start' has taken the place of 'inception' and the verb 'compete' is used instead of 'vie'.\nPart 3.

He needs to sell a total of $800 / $5 = 160 candy bars to reach his goal.\nThe answer: 160\nReverse engineering the question: Nick is trying to raise money for a charity. He is selling candy bars for $5. He is also selling chocolate oranges for $10. He wants to raise $1000. He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: First find the number of pinecones eaten by reindeer: 20% * 2000 pinecones = 400 pine cones. Then find the total number of pinecones eaten by squirrels: 400 pine cones * 2 = 800 pine cones. Then subtract those two amounts to find the number of pinecones left: 2000 pinecones - 400 pine cones - 800 pine cones = 800 pinecones. Divide that number by 4 to find the number that are collected for fires: 800 pinecones / 4 = 200 pine cones. Then subtract that number from the 800 pinecones to find the total left on the ground: 800 pine cones - 200 pinecones = 600 pine cones.\nThe answer: 600\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: There are 2000 pinecones on the ground. 20% are eaten by reindeer. Twice as many are eaten by squirrels as reindeer. 25% of the remainder are collected to make fires. How many pinecones are left?\n\n\nHe drives for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours. So he spends 4 * 2.5 = 10 hours at the beach. That means the total trip took 10 + 4 = 14 hours.\nThe answer: 14\nReverse engineering the question: Jake decides to go to the beach for a fun day. It is a 2-hour drive each way. He then spends 2.5 times at long at the beach as his total driving time. How much time does the trip take?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Padma traded 2 + 15 of her cards = 17 cards. Robert traded 10 + 8 of his cards = 18 cards. In total, between both of them Padma and Robert traded 17 + 18 = 35 cards.\nThe answer: 35\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert?\n\n\nCasey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy so she can hula hoop for 10 - 3 = 7 minutes.

He didn't like to work on his father's farm and hoped to find a job in a big city. He went from one company to another but no one wanted him. With little money left, he got to the station, sad and tired. All he wanted to do was go back to his small town. It was very late at night and the station was full of people. They were waiting to buy tickets of the last train. He bought the last ticket, and he was very happy. At that time, a woman with a crying baby walked to him and asked him to sell her the ticket. He gave her the ticket because he thought they needed it more than he did. After the train left, he sat on the bench and didn't know where to go. Suddenly, an old man came and said, \"Young man, I have seen what you did to the woman. I am the owner of a big company. I need a good young man like you. Would you like to work for me?

About 4% of the population is what scientists call \"amusic\". People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \"I used to hate parties,\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify  this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors. Many amusics are happy when their condition is finally diagnosed . For years, Margaret felt embarrassed about her problem music. Now she knows that she is not alone. That makes it easier for her to explain. When people invite me to a concert, I just say \"No, thanks. I'm amusic.\" says Margret. Question: Amusics are the people who   _  .

Article: The world itself is becoming much smaller by using modern traffic and modern communication. Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest problems is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even eat it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problems was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in one place, man moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad for all living things in the world, but it is not the only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills our fish and pollutes our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight pollution. They stop people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from putting dirty smoke into the air. Pollution by SO2 is now the most dangerous kind of air pollutions. It is caused by heavy traffic. We are sure that if there are fewer people driving there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it. That means keeping the land, water and air clean. And we must take care of the rise in pollution at the same time. : Question: Pollution comes in may ways. We can even hear it.

He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich; his young adult daughter Barbara surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood, a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning. His longtime girlfriend, Marjorie West, is dismayed, but after the party he assures her that, as usual, he will return to her once he exhausts his obsession with Barbara. He is only marrying Barbara because she would not go to bed with him otherwise. Rich orders two servants to watch Grant's bungalow on the estate, but Grant uses a cutout mounted on a record player to cast a moving shadow on the curtain to make it appear that he is pacing restlessly, and slips back to the main house.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\ninput question: Question: \"Who did Buddhism interact with other than Greek and Indian groups?\"  Context: \"The gradual spread of Buddhism into adjacent areas meant that it came into contact with new ethnical groups. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, to changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions—themselves influenced by Buddhism. Striking examples of this syncretistic development can be seen in the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and in the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra. A Greek king, Menander, has even been immortalized in the Buddhist canon.\"  Answer:???\noutput answer: Persian\n\nQuestion: \"What fails to prevent evaporation in the bulb?\"  Context: \"On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a tungsten filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.\"  Answer:\n----\nAnswer: operating it in a vacuum\n\nQ: Question: \"Gaddafi lives in the?\"  Context: \"Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred. Dissidents abroad or \"stray dogs\" were also publicly threatened with death and sometimes killed by government hit squads. His government's treatment of non-Arab Libyans has also came in for criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's government was frequently criticized for not being democratic, with Freedom House consistently giving Libya under Gaddafi the \"Not Free\" ranking for civil liberties and political rights.\"  Answer:\nA: Middle East\n\nQuestion: Question: \"Who received more than 12.5 million votes?\"  Context: \"Goodluck Jonathan served as Nigeria's president till 16 April 2011, when a new presidential election in Nigeria was conducted.

Though using switches in your own home is kind of easy, wiring a person may not be that easy for everybody. An ON-OFF switch is in fact quite simple to wire. You will discover various kinds of switches, but for this instance, let's say you're installing a single-pole toggle switch, an incredibly widespread change (as well as easiest).\nYou will find 3 shades of wires in the usual single-pole toggle switch: black, white, and inexperienced. Splice the black wire in two and connect them over the terminal screws - a single on best plus the other within the base screw with the change. The white wire serves for a resource of uninterrupted ability and is typically linked into a gentle colored terminal screw (e.g., silver). Join the green wire on the ground screw of the switch.\nThese measures would typically be sufficient to help make a standard change perform with out a dilemma. On the other hand, in the event you are certainly not self-assured that you simply can accomplish the task correctly and safely you much better let the pros get it done as an alternative. Following all, there's a cause why this endeavor is one of the most commonly encountered electrical wiring thoughts asked by the majority of people.\nFor some purpose, ways to wire a ceiling fan is additionally considered one of the most common electrical wiring concerns. To simplify this activity, you can use a single swap to get a single ceiling fan. To wire the admirer, it's only a subject of connecting the black wire from the ceiling fan into the black wire of your swap. If there is a light, the blue wire need to be connected to your black wire on the change as well.\nYou will discover causes why they're the most frequently questioned electrical wiring thoughts. Just one, quite a few think it really is simple to accomplish, and two, they're the prevalent electrical duties at your house.

After he returned the fish to the store, he exchanged them for 3 new fish + 8 fish that were left = 11 fish now in his tank.\nThe answer: 11\nReverse engineering the question: Jonah decided to set up an aquarium. He started with 14 small fish. He added 2 more, but they ate 6 of his original fish before he could remove them and take them back to the store. He exchanged them for 3 new fish. How many fish does Jonah have now?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Since the number of oranges that Martin has now is twice the number of limes, there are 50 / 2 = 25 limes. The number of fruits she has now is 50 oranges + 25 limes = 75. If she had eaten half of the number of fruits that she had, initially Martin had 2 * 75 = 150 fruits.\nThe answer: 150\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: After eating half of the number of fruits he had, Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes. If he has 50 oranges now, how many fruits did he initially have?\n\n\nThe total marks of science and music are 70 + 80 = 150.

When you add the marks she scored in physics to the total marks of the other subjects, the full marks become 235 + 40 = 275.\nThe answer: 275\nReverse engineering the question: Teresa scored 70 marks in science, 80 in music, 85 in social studies, and the physics exam, which was the hardest test that Teresa had ever taken in her entire life, she scored half as many marks as she scored in music. Calculate the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects.\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Let A be Matthew’s age. Rebecca is A - 2 years old. Freddy is A + 4 years old. Their ages add up to 35, so A + A - 2 + A + 4 = 3A + 2 = 35. Therefore, 3A = 35 - 2 = 33. Matthew is A = 33 / 3 = 11 years old. Thus, Freddy is 11 + 4 = 15 years old.\nThe answer: 15\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Cynthia has three children whose ages add up to 35. Matthew is two years older than Rebecca and four years younger than Freddy. How many years old is Freddy?\n\n\nBob got 12 * 10 = 120 skips. Jim got 15 * 10 = 150 skips. So in total they got 120 + 150 = 270 skips.\nThe answer: 270\nReverse engineering the question: Bob and Jim decide to skip rocks. Bob can skip a rock 12 times. Jim can skip a rock 15 times. If they each skipped 10 rocks how many total skips did they get?\n\n\nIf the price of a lawnmower was $1800 a year ago, 2 / 5 less than the cost right now, then it now costs 2 / 5 * 1800 = $720 more to buy one lawnmower.

Biafra represented nationalist aspirations of the Igbo people, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the Northern-dominated federal government. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonisation of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria.

Law-enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.

A charging port supplies up to 500 mA at 5 V, up to the rated current at 3.6 V or more, and drops its output voltage if the portable device attempts to draw more than the rated current.

Here's how the process works:\nGenre=fantasy adventure\n\nStep 1: I provide a text excerpt to be revised, and I define parameter values that you should measure.\nStep 2: You provide a table measuring these parameters in the text:\n\nLexical Density (LD),Complexity (CO), Emotional Intensity (EI), Realism vs. Fantasy (RF), Familiarity vs. Novelty (FN), Sentiment (SE), Pace (PA), Direct Speech (DS), Imagery Density (ID), Symbolism (SY), Simile and Metaphor (SM), Dark vs. Light (DL), Allusion (AL), Action Density (AD), Seriousness vs. Humor (SH))\n\nMeasure all parameters on a 1-10 scale, and present this data in columnar format, such that row 1 contains the parameter codes (LD, EI, DI, etc.), and row 2 contains the parameter values.\n\nStep 3: I provide specific parameter updates, and you will revise the text excerpt in a way that reflects the updates and does not change parameter values I do not specify, and your revisions should not significantly change the word count of the original text, and you should preserve the point of view, character names, plot structure, and content of the original text. Do not continue the story beyond the scope of the original text. After each revision, you will provide a brief synopsis of the revision and act as a critic of the revision produced to offer suggestions for additional improvement.\n\nStep 4: I will evaluate the revised text and provide feedback for additional revisions.\n\nWe will repeat steps 2-4 until I am satisfied with the revised text. Are you ready?<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [1.703125, -3.6875, 2.578125, 1.703125, 1.703125], "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it combines creative writing skill with constrained, rule-governed editing and quantitative analysis.

Movie title: The Driller Killer Context: Artist Reno Miller (Abel Ferrara) and his girlfriend Carol enter a Catholic church, where he approaches an elderly bearded man (revealed as a derelict) kneeling at the pulpit. The derelict seizes Reno's hand, causing him and Carol to flee from the church, unknown to him that the derelict contained a paper with Reno's information and requested a meeting with him. Later, at his apartment, Reno receives a large phone bill and cannot pay his rent. He shares with Carol and her lover Pamela, in a derelict-filled neighbourhood in Union Square. Reno visits Dalton, a gallery owner, and tells him that he is currently painting a masterpiece. Reno asks for a weekâs extension and a loan of $500 to cover the rent, however Dalton refuses, saying that he already lent enough money to Reno. However, if he finishes a satisfactory painting in one week Dalton will buy it for the necessary amount. The following day, a No Wave band entitled the Roosters begin practising their music in a nearby apartment, in which the music makes Reno unnerved and frustrated. At 2:00 in the morning, Reno becomes more agitated from the Roosters' music while painting. After seeing his own image saturated in blood, Reno walks in the dark. He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he takes him down an alley where gang members are seen chasing another bum. Reno drops the bum and vows that he will not end up like a derelict. The next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him. He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money.

Croce wrote the lyrics after his wife Ingrid told him she was pregnant, in December 1970. It appeared on his 1972 ABC debut album You Do n't Mess Around with Jim. ABC originally did not intend to release the song as a single; but when Croce was killed in a plane crash in September 1973, the song's lyrics, dealing with mortality and the wish to have more time, had additional resonance. The song subsequently received a large amount of airplay as an album track and demand for a single release built. When it was eventually issued as a 7 ``, it became his second and final No. 1 hit. After the single had finished its two-week run at the top in early January 1974, the album You Do n't Mess Around with Jim became No. 1 for five weeks.

{"original_prompt": "<bos><start_of_turn>user\nQ: I watch movies for a living, picking out which ones are good enough to distribute... Tossing aside those that don't make the cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this, I'm just leading you to how I came to watch \"The Gospel of Lou\"... Anyways... So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually sit through all of them. I don't actually \"watch\" everything, usually I just look over at the TV occasionally while I'm working the scan for production value, performance, and how well the story is being presented. If something catches my eye I'll take the time to watch it. \"Lou\" drew me in during the first few minutes where I closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the TV so I could completely tune in. Needless to say I was enthralled throughout the whole movie. The story is told well, the characters are either endearing or repulsive (depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character) and all very well played. At times I caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss. I've heard other people's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes, other time extreme elation... I was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. Sadly I was unable to acquire it because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short. That's the way it goes sometimes... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one and I can't wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and great fortune to you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are without a doubt a talent to watch for.\nA: positive\nQ: \"The Godfather\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"Star Wars\", \"Goodfellas\" None of the above compare to the complex brilliance of \"The Sopranos\". Each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity, completely and utterly three dimensional. We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs. evil, he is evil. Soprano is the most provocative, intricate, and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history. If you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer, and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment, watch \"The Sopranos\". I defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1, and not want to continue with the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential to anybody's collection **** of out 4\nA: positive\nQ: I may be getting ahead of myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I watched it piece-by-piece on TCM last night, the question arises to me: Why did they do that? putting their lives in jeopardy, many of them died on the trek, why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey, just to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the \"land of milk and honey\", why didn't they just stay there? Would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it was, to do it for that purpose alone, shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. Risk death for a cow?? Better them than I!\nA: positive\nQ: When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. Also, there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.\n\nWell, the 1973 TV version of \"Double Indemnity\" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems world-weary and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.\n\nRobert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson's boss Norton, and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context.\n\nHowever, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one film that never should have been remade.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "original_scores": [-2.4375, -2.4375, -2.4375, -2.4375, -2.4375], "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"This prompt is challenging because it requires fine-grained sentiment classification on long, nuanced movie reviews that often mix praise and criticism, include sarcasm or rhetorical questions, contain noisy artifacts (ratings, formatting oddities), and rely on domain-specific cues (acting, direction, editing).

Provide a concise single-action answer that logically precedes the listed steps.\n- The exposure lamp illuminates the original and an image is formed on a photosensitive drum\n- A sheet of paper is drawn past the drum and toner transfers the image onto the paper\n- Heat and pressure fuse the toner to the paper\n- The finished copy exits into the output tray and is ready to be collected", "reference_answer": "N/A"}
