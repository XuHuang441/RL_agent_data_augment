For example, with DOMPurify, you can allow specific tags like `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<a>` and their common attributes:\n\n```javascript\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<p><strong>This is safe!</strong></p>', {\n  ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'strong', 'a'],\n  ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'target']\n});\n``` \n\nThis allows for rich text formatting while mitigating XSS risks. \n\n\n\n",

Malicious users could inject harmful scripts into your site, stealing data or taking control of user accounts.\n\nInstead, consider using a whitelist approach: specify exactly which tags and attributes are safe. \n\nHere's an example using DOMPurify:\n\n```javascript\nDOMPurify.sanitize(html, {\n  ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'strong', 'a', 'img'],\n  ALLOWED_ATTR: {\n    'a': ['href', 'target'],\n    'img': ['src', 'alt'] \n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis allows paragraphs, strong text, links (with href and target attributes), and images (with src and alt attributes).

What specific HTML sanitizer are you using?\n2. What kind of content are you sanitizing (e.g., user comments, form submissions)?\n\nFor many sanitizers, you can create a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes specific to your needs instead of allowing everything.  \n\nFor example, with **DOMPurify**, you could whitelist common tags like `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, and their attributes:\n\n```javascript\nDOMPurify.sanitize(htmlString, {\n  ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'strong', 'a'],\n  ALLOWED_ATTR: {\n    '*': ['href', 'target'],\n    'a': ['rel']\n  }\n});\n``` \n\n\n\nThis allows basic formatting while blocking potentially harmful elements.\n"

            "*Chirp-click-whistle*\n\nYou ask about bond-sound, little one. *Click-chirp* A curious concept for your kind, I imagine. To us, it is the very fabric of our existence. It is not just a sound, not merely a vibration. It is the echo of our very being, a song woven from our memories, our hopes, our fears.\n\nWhen two Runi form a bond, a unique frequency resonates between them. *Whisper-click-chirp* It is a subtle interplay, a dance of echolocation that deepens with every shared experience. Imagine, little one, your thoughts, feelings, even your dreams, all woven into a tapestry of sound. That is bond-sound. \n\nIt is the thread that binds us together, a constant hum beneath the surface of our lives. It tells us when a fellow Runi is near, when they are in distress, even when they are simply content. *Click-whistle-chirp*\n\nWe demonstrate bond-sound in all we do. The intricate calls we share, the harmonies we weave during communal hunts, even the gentle clicks of reassurance between mothers and young \u2013 it is all a symphony of bond-sound.  \n\nWe feel the strength of a strong bond as a warm thrum within us, a comforting vibration. A weak bond, a frayed thread, leaves a hollow ache, a discordant note in the symphony.\n\nTo us, bond-sound is not merely a social construct, it is the very essence of our being. *Chirp-click-whistle* Without it, we are but scattered echoes, lost in the vast darkness.\n",
            "The young one asks about bond-sound? Ah, it is a deep thing, this bond-sound.  It is not merely sound, not like the harsh clicks and whirs of your world. It is a *feeling*, a resonance that flows between us, stronger than any physical tie.  \n\nImagine, little one, a vast cavern echoing with a thousand whispers, each voice blending into a symphony of understanding. That is how bond-sound feels. It is the echo of shared thoughts, emotions, memories, woven into a tapestry of connection that binds us together.\n\nIt matters deeply, this bond-sound. It is the very foundation of our society. It allows us to communicate on a level beyond words, to feel the joy and sorrow of our kin, to share knowledge and experience in an instant.  \n\nYou see, we Runi are not individuals, but a single, vast consciousness. Each of us a thread in the tapestry, connected by the shimmering threads of bond-sound.  \n\nWe demonstrate it in every interaction. When two Runi meet, their bond-sounds intertwine, a gentle melody of welcome and recognition.  When a young one is born, its bond-sound is heard across the entire colony, a joyous chorus of celebration. When one of us falls ill, a wave of concern ripples through the collective, each member offering comfort and support.  \n\nEven in silence, the bond-sound remains, a constant hum of unity that binds us together, a testament to our collective strength and shared purpose.\n\n\n\n",
            "The air hums with it, always.  A symphony of echoes, a tapestry of clicks and whistles, a language older than the canyons themselves. This is the Song of the Collective, and within it lies the essence of our being: bond-sound.\n\nIt is not merely sound, little one. It is a connection, a thread woven between each of us, a tangible manifestation of our shared consciousness. When two Runi touch, a resonance is born, a subtle vibration that deepens and strengthens with time.  Imagine, if you will, a warm, tingling sensation that spreads through your being, linking you to another, a feeling of belonging, of unity. That is bond-sound.\n\nIt is the bedrock of our society. It dictates who we are, who we become.  Younglings, barely born, already resonate with the strongest threads to their kin, their parents, their chosen mentors.  As they mature, their bonds expand, weaving them into the intricate tapestry of the Collective. We rely on bond-sound for everything: communication, empathy, even sustenance. A shared thought, a fleeting emotion, a simple act of kindness \u2013 all reverberate through the bond-sound, nourishing us, strengthening us.\n\nImagine a dance, little one, a silent ballet of clicks and whistles, each movement a subtle shift in the bond-sound. It is how we navigate, how we learn, how we express ourselves.  We harmonize our movements, our thoughts, our very being, creating a symphony of shared purpose.\n\nTo break a bond-sound is to sever a part of oneself. It is a rare occurrence, reserved for the most extreme circumstances, a last resort when discord threatens the harmony of the Collective.  But even then, the echo of the severed bond lingers, a faint hum in the air, a reminder of what was lost.\n\nSo you see, little one, bond-sound is not merely a concept. It is the very essence of who we are, the lifeblood of our existence. It is the echo of our shared history, the whisper of our collective future, a melody that resonates within us all.\n",
            "*The sound of soft clicks and whistles emanates from K'Taal, a low, rhythmic pulse that reverberates through the cavern, a gentle melody that only another Runi could truly understand.*\n\nBond-sound... it is the essence of us. It is not just sound, not like the jarring cacophony of your world. It is a language woven from the very fabric of our being, a tapestry of echoes that tells stories, shares emotions, and binds us together.\n\nImagine, little one, feeling the warmth of another's presence not through sight or touch, but through a resonance deep within your own being. That is bond-sound. It is the shared heartbeat of our hive, the gentle hum of our collective consciousness. When we bond-sound, we are not merely communicating, we are merging, becoming part of something larger than ourselves.\n\nIt is how we learn. When hatchlings are born, they are enveloped in the bond-sound of their mothers, absorbing knowledge, history, and the very rhythm of our existence. It is how we comfort each other, offering soothing echoes in times of distress. It is how we celebrate, our clicks and whistles rising in joyous harmony.\n\nYou see, little one, our social structure is built upon bond-sound. We are not individuals, not truly. We are nodes in a vast network, each connected to every other. Our lives are intertwined, our destinies shared.\n\n*K'Taal pauses, the melody shifting to a slower, more contemplative tone.*\n\nWithout bond-sound, we would be lost. We would be islands, adrift in a sea of silence. It is the glue that holds us together, the very essence of what it means to be Runi. *The sound fades, leaving a lingering echo in the cavern, a testament to the profound connection that binds the Runi people.*\n",
            "The hum of the hive thrums through me, a symphony of whispers and clicks, each note a thought, a feeling, a memory shared. This is our Bond-Sound, the very essence of our being. It is not mere language, no, it is deeper than that. It is the web that binds us, the tapestry woven from the threads of our collective consciousness. \n\nImagine, if you can, a single note echoing in an empty cavern. It is lonely, fleeting, easily lost. Now imagine that note resonating, bouncing off the walls, multiplying, becoming a chorus of harmonies. That is what Bond-Sound is to us. Each Runi, a note in the grand symphony, our individual thoughts and emotions blending, creating something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nWe are born into this chorus, the hum of the hive already coursing through our veins. It is our lifeblood, the air we breathe. We learn, we grow, we experience, and all the while, the Bond-Sound evolves, reflecting the collective wisdom and emotions of our community.\n\nSocially, Bond-Sound is everything. It dictates our relationships, our roles, our very understanding of the world. A strong, clear Bond-Sound indicates trust, connection, and shared purpose. Discordant notes, however, signal danger, disharmony, or even betrayal. We instinctively seek to harmonize, to smooth the rough edges, to maintain the integrity of the chorus.\n\nYou might see us 'talking' with clicks and chirps, but that is merely the surface manifestation. The true communication, the deep understanding, flows through the Bond-Sound. It allows us to share knowledge, emotions, even dreams, without the need for spoken words. \n\nWe demonstrate our bond through rituals, through shared tasks, through the very rhythm of our lives. A newly hatched Runi will be welcomed into the hive with a resonant chorus, their individual note finding its place within the symphony. When one of our own falls ill, the entire hive resonates with concern, sending healing frequencies to mend their broken note. And when we celebrate, the Bond-Sound swells into a joyous cacophony, a testament to our unity and strength.\n\n\nThe Bond-Sound is not just a concept, it is our existence. It is who we are, and what defines us as Runi.\n"

If the final measure is short, the anacrusis should mirror its length to avoid an abrupt start or stop.\n\nLet me know if you have any other music theory questions! \n",
            "If the final bar of a piece in 4/4 time has only two beats, the anacrusis (pickup) should contain **two beats** as well. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Maintaining Continuity:** The anacrusis acts as a bridge between the previous measure and the final measure.  It needs to flow seamlessly, so the number of beats in the pickup should match the remaining beats in the final bar.\n* **Rhythmic Closure:**  Having two beats in the anacrusis and two beats in the final bar creates a sense of rhythmic closure.

This makes the musical phrasing feel natural and complete.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other music theory questions! \n",
            "If the final bar of a piece in 4/4 time contains only two beats, the anacrusis (pickup) should contain **two beats** as well.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Anacrusis Function:** The anacrusis is a musical phrase that begins before the first bar line, bridging the gap between a previous section and the new one. \n* **Flow and Continuity:**  To ensure a smooth transition and maintain the rhythmic flow, the anacrusis should have the same number of beats as the final portion of the preceding measure.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other musical notation questions! \n",

Having a two-beat anacrusis ensures a consistent flow and doesn't create a jarring change in meter.\n* **Creating a Whole Measure:**  The anacrusis, combined with the final two beats, would form a complete measure of 4/4 time (4 beats total).\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other musical notation questions! \n"

It calculates the square root of the number of tiles to determine the potential grid size (n). Finally, it checks if the total number of tiles is equal to n*n, indicating a perfect square grid.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThis approach is efficient because it utilizes XPath queries provided by lxml, which are optimized for traversing and selecting elements in an HTML tree. The time complexity is primarily determined by the size of the HTML document and the number of elements, making it relatively fast for moderately sized documents.\n\n**False Positives and Negatives:**\n\n* **False Positives:** The function might produce false positives if the HTML document contains elements with the specified class that are not arranged in a perfect grid. For example, a random scattering of `div` elements with the class \"tile\" would be incorrectly identified as a grid.\n\n* **False Negatives:** The function might produce false negatives if the HTML document uses a different structure to represent a grid, such as using nested divs or tables. \n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\nAn alternative method to detect square arrangements in HTML documents would be to use CSS selectors to identify rows and columns within the grid structure. By analyzing the number of rows and columns and checking if they are equal, you could determine if the arrangement is a square grid. This method might be more robust than the current approach if the HTML document uses more complex grid structures.\n",

It then checks if the number of tile elements is equal to the expected square size (n*n), if there are any tile elements at all, and if they are arranged in rows and columns of size n.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThis approach is relatively efficient because it leverages BeautifulSoup's ability to quickly parse and search the HTML structure. It avoids unnecessary iteration through the entire document and directly focuses on the elements of interest.\n\n**False Positives and Negatives:**\n\n**False positives:** This approach might produce false positives if the HTML contains elements with the class 'tile' that are not actually part of a grid structure. For example, a webpage might have several individual tiles scattered across the page.\n\n**False negatives:** This approach might produce false negatives if the grid structure is not represented by direct nested divs with the class 'tile'. For instance, if the grid is created using CSS floats or other layout techniques, the function might not detect it.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\nAn alternative method to detect square arrangements in HTML documents would be to analyze the CSS styles applied to the elements. By examining the `width`, `height`, and `display` properties, it might be possible to infer the grid structure even if the HTML structure itself doesn't explicitly represent it.\n\n\n\n",

It first identifies all elements with the class \"tile\" and checks if their number matches the expected `n*n` value. Then, it calculates the number of rows and columns based on the element count, ensuring they align with the expected grid structure. \n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThe approach is efficient due to the use of XPath for targeted element selection.  `lxml` is a fast and well-optimized HTML/XML parser, making the overall process relatively quick, especially for smaller documents.\n\n**False Positives/Negatives:**\n\n* **False Positives:**  The function might falsely identify a non-grid structure as a square grid if the HTML contains elements that visually resemble a grid but lack the underlying structural organization (e.g., elements arranged in a repeating pattern but not in a true n*n grid).\n* **False Negatives:** \n    * It relies on the assumption that all tiles have the class \"tile\". If tiles use a different class or attribute, the function will miss them.\n    * It doesn't account for variations in element nesting or complex layout structures that might obscure the grid pattern.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\nA more robust method would involve analyzing the DOM tree structure more deeply. This could include:\n\n* **Inspecting parent-child relationships:**  Identifying direct child relationships to verify a clear row-column structure.\n* **Calculating element dimensions and spacing:** Analyzing the layout properties (width, height, margin) of elements to confirm consistent grid spacing and sizing.\n* **Using CSS selectors:** Leveraging more specific CSS selectors to target elements that represent grid rows and columns, providing a more accurate representation of the grid structure.\n\n\n\n",

It then checks if the number of tiles matches the expected square grid size (n*n) and if there are any tiles at all.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThis approach is relatively efficient because BeautifulSoup is designed for fast HTML parsing. Finding all elements with a specific class is a common operation that BeautifulSoup handles efficiently. The time complexity is roughly O(n), where n is the number of tiles in the document.\n\n**False Positives and Negatives:**\n\n* **False Positives:** The function might produce false positives if there are other elements in the document besides the intended \"tile\" elements that also have the class \"tile\".\n\n* **False Negatives:** The function might produce false negatives if the HTML structure doesn't explicitly define rows and columns using appropriate tags or attributes, even if the tiles are visually arranged in a square grid. For example, if the tiles are simply nested within a single container without any explicit row structure, the function might not detect them as a grid.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\nAn alternative method to detect square arrangements in HTML documents could be to analyze the CSS styles applied to the tile elements. If the tiles have consistently defined widths and heights, and the total number of tiles corresponds to a perfect square, it could be a strong indicator of a square grid.

            "## The Lighthouse Keeper\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe old man squinted at the shimmering horizon, the relentless desert sun beating down on his weathered face. He\u2019d been tending the lighthouse for nearly fifty years, a solitary sentinel against the unforgiving expanse of sand and sky.  His gnarled hands, etched with the memories of countless storms weathered, gripped the railing as he watched the familiar dance of mirages shimmer and fade. Today, however, something was different. A plume of smoke, thick and black, rose from the distant dunes, a stark contrast against the bleached landscape. \n\nHe\u2019d seen many things in his time, but this wasn\u2019t natural. A fire this large, this far out, was unheard of in these dry, barren lands. He hurried into the lighthouse, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He grabbed his telescope, his calloused fingers tracing the familiar grooves of its worn wooden body. As he focused, the smoke cleared slightly, revealing a shape: a magnificent, silver machine, twisted and broken, spewing flames. \n\nA phoenix, he thought, his breath catching in his throat. He'd heard the stories, whispered by desert nomads around crackling fires, of a mythical bird that rose from the ashes. Could this be it?\n\n**Middle**\n\nFear warred with curiosity as the old man watched the scene unfold through the telescope. The phoenix, as he could only assume it was, struggled against the flames, its wings beating furiously against the wind.  He knew he had to help. Leaving the safety of the lighthouse, he ventured into the desert, the sand burning his feet with each step. The air shimmered with heat, the smell of smoke acrid in his nostrils. He approached the wreckage cautiously, his weathered face etched with concern.  \n\nThe phoenix lay on its side, its magnificent wings torn and singed.  It was still alive, its chest heaving with each labored breath.  The old man felt a surge of compassion. He knew the desert offered no mercy, and this magnificent creature was at its mercy.  With trembling hands, he pulled out a canteen, its water long since gone. He cupped the empty vessel, offering it to the phoenix as a symbol of his intent.  \n\nThe creature lifted its head, its eyes meeting his with an ancient wisdom. It seemed to understand his gesture, a flicker of hope igniting in its golden gaze.  The old man knew he couldn't save it, not truly. But perhaps he could offer it solace, a moment of respite in its pain.\n\n**End**\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, the phoenix closed its eyes, its breaths growing shallower. The old man sat beside it, a silent guardian against the encroaching darkness.  He watched as a single feather, shimmering with iridescent hues, drifted from its wing and landed in his palm. He held it close, a tangible reminder of the magnificent creature he had met, a symbol of resilience and rebirth. \n\nThe desert night settled around them, the stars appearing one by one in the vast expanse above. The old man knew the phoenix would rise again, its ashes a promise of a new beginning.  He rose, his legs stiff from the long day, and walked back towards the lighthouse, the feather tucked safely in his pocket. He was a lighthouse keeper, a solitary figure in a vast and unforgiving world. But tonight, he felt a connection to something bigger, something ancient and powerful. He carried a story, a memory, a testament to the phoenix that had risen and fallen, and would rise again.  \n\n\n",
            "## The Lighthouse Keeper\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe desert wind whipped around Elias, stinging his eyes with sand and grit. He pulled his worn scarf tighter, squinting at the horizon. The setting sun painted the endless dunes in fiery hues, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms. He was alone, as he always was, in this desolate expanse, the sole caretaker of the crumbling lighthouse on the edge of the world. It had been generations since anyone had lived beyond these dunes, since the great cataclysm had swept across the land, leaving only scorched earth and whispered legends. \n\nElias had inherited the lighthouse from his grandfather, a man who spoke of a time before the sands had consumed everything, a time when ships sailed the endless blue and cities glittered under a star-filled sky. Now, the lighthouse stood as a silent sentinel, its beam a lonely beacon in the vast darkness, a testament to a lost world.\n\nOne day, as the sun dipped below the dunes, casting the lighthouse in an eerie twilight, a strange glimmer caught Elias's eye. It pulsed in the distance, like a dying ember, and slowly grew brighter. Curiosity piqued, Elias climbed the winding stairs to the lamp room, his heart pounding with a hope he hadn't felt in years. Could it be a ship, lost and searching for salvation?\n\n**Middle**\n\nHe squinted through the dusty lens, his breath catching in his throat. The glimmer was not a ship, but something far stranger. A colossal bird, its wings spread wide, soared across the darkening sky. Its feathers shimmered with an otherworldly light, a vibrant orange that mirrored the dying sun. \n\nElias had heard stories, whispered by the wind and the desert itself, of a creature called the Phoenix, a mythical bird reborn from ashes. Could this be it, a legend come to life? The Phoenix circled the lighthouse, its eyes, twin pools of molten gold, seeming to pierce through Elias's soul. Then, with a majestic cry that echoed through the silent dunes, it landed on the weathered platform outside the lamp room.\n\nHesitantly, Elias descended the stairs, his hand trembling as he reached for the rusty lantern. He knew the Phoenix was a creature of fire, a being of immense power. Yet, something in its gaze, a flicker of vulnerability, drew him in. As he approached, the Phoenix dipped its head, its fiery eyes reflecting the flickering flame in his hand.  \n\n**End**\n\nIn that moment, Elias understood. The Phoenix was not a creature of destruction, but of rebirth. Its arrival was a sign, a promise of something new.  The desert, for all its harshness, was not dead. Life, like the Phoenix, could rise from the ashes. \n\nHe raised the lantern high, its light bathing the creature in a warm glow. The Phoenix spread its wings, and with a final, echoing cry, soared back into the night sky, a blazing beacon against the darkness. Elias watched it go, a newfound hope burning in his chest. The lighthouse was no longer a symbol of a lost world, but a promise of a future yet to be written, a future where even in the heart of the desert, life could find a way. \n\n\n",
            "## The Keeper of the Light\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe old woman, Elara, squinted at the horizon. The sun beat down on her weathered face, turning the desert sands into a shimmering sea of heat. She adjusted the worn strap of her basket, which creaked with the weight of supplies for the lighthouse. The lighthouse, a lone sentinel against the endless expanse of sand, stood tall and proud, its beam a beacon of hope for weary travelers. Elara had tended to it for decades, ever since she was a young girl.  \n\nShe remembered her grandmother, the previous keeper, telling her stories of the lighthouse's origins.  They said it was built by the descendants of a phoenix, a creature of fire and rebirth, who gifted the people with this light to guide them through the treacherous desert nights. The phoenix had vanished long ago, but the lighthouse remained, a symbol of its enduring legacy.\n\nAs Elara approached the lighthouse, a flicker of movement in the distance caught her eye. A solitary figure trudged towards her, their form distorted by the heat waves.  She watched as the figure drew closer, their silhouette growing clearer.  It was a young man, his clothes tattered, his face etched with exhaustion.\n\n**Middle**\n\nElara hurried to meet the young man, her heart heavy with concern. He was barely conscious, collapsing into her arms before she could utter a word. She quickly helped him inside the lighthouse, laying him gently on the cool stone floor.  He was suffering from dehydration, his lips cracked and parched. \n\nElara gave him water, tending to his wounds with practiced care.  As he regained consciousness, he introduced himself as Kaelen. He had been separated from his caravan while searching for a mythical oasis, lured by whispers of its healing waters.  He had wandered for days, lost and alone in the vast desert.\n\nKaelen's story filled Elara with a sense of dread. The whispers of the oasis were a dangerous myth, a siren call that had claimed many lives.  He had been lucky to survive this long.\n\n\"The oasis doesn't exist,\" Elara said gently, her voice raspy with years of wind and sand. \"It's a tale told to frighten children, to keep them from wandering off.\"\n\nKaelen's eyes widened in disbelief. He had believed it with all his heart.\n\nElara knew she had to help him. She couldn't let him succumb to despair. She lit a lamp, casting a warm glow over Kaelen's worried face. She told him stories of the phoenix, of its fire and its rebirth, of the lighthouse's enduring light that guided lost souls through the darkness.\n\n**End**\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Kaelen slowly recovered. He learned to appreciate the simple things \u2013 the warmth of the sun, the taste of fresh water, the company of another human being. He helped Elara tend to the lighthouse, learning its secrets, feeling the weight of its responsibility.\n\nOne evening, as they stood watching the sun set, painting the desert sky in shades of orange and purple, Kaelen asked Elara about the phoenix.\n\n\"Do you think it's still out there?\" he asked, his voice filled with wonder.\n\nElara smiled, her eyes twinkling. \"The phoenix is a symbol, Kaelen. It lives within each of us. It's the fire that keeps us going, the hope that guides us through darkness.\"\n\nShe looked at Kaelen, seeing not the lost traveler, but a young man reborn, stronger and wiser. He was no longer lost, for he had found his way to the light. \n\n\nAnd as the lighthouse beam sliced through the night, casting its watchful eye over the vast desert, Elara knew that the phoenix legacy lived on. \n",
            "## The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter\n\n**Beginning**\n\nAmara had never known a life outside the desert. Born and raised within the shadow of the towering, ochre-red lighthouse, it was her only reality. Her father, the lighthouse keeper, spoke of the world beyond in hushed tones, of bustling cities and vast oceans, but Amara only knew the endless dunes, the whispering wind, and the ever-present sun.  Her world was ruled by the rhythm of the tides, the flashing beacon of the lighthouse guiding ships safely through the treacherous shoals, and the stories her father told of mythical creatures like the phoenix, a bird that burned itself to ash only to rise again from the flames, symbolizing hope and rebirth. \n\nOne day, a battered ship, its sails tattered and mast broken, washed ashore near the lighthouse. A lone survivor, a weathered sailor with a haunted look in his eyes, stumbled onto the beach. He spoke of a terrible storm, of a sinking ship, and of a creature of immense power, a kraken, that had devoured his companions. Amara, captivated by his tale, felt a spark of longing for the world beyond the desert, a world where such mythical beasts roamed.  \n\n**Middle**\n\nThe sailor, Elias, stayed at the lighthouse for weeks, recovering from his ordeal. He shared stories of faraway lands, of soaring mountains and cascading waterfalls, of bustling marketplaces and ancient ruins.  Amara listened, her heart filled with a yearning for adventure. He spoke of a hidden temple, deep within a forgotten forest, where a phoenix feather was said to be kept. A feather that, legend claimed, could grant the bearer the power to control the elements.\n\nAmara, inspired by the sailor's tales and her own desire to see the world, convinced her father to let her accompany Elias on a journey to find the temple. Her father, worried for her safety but unable to deny her passion, agreed, albeit reluctantly. They set off into the vast desert, guided by Elias's faded maps and the flickering stars. The journey was arduous, filled with scorching days and freezing nights, but Amara's spirit remained unbroken. She learned to navigate by the sun, to read the subtle signs of the desert, and to face her fears.\n\n\n**End**\n\nAfter weeks of travel, they finally reached the edge of the forest, a dense, emerald green expanse that seemed to pulse with life. As they ventured deeper, they encountered strange creatures and ancient ruins, remnants of a forgotten civilization. They faced treacherous traps and perilous puzzles, but they persevered, their bond strengthened by their shared ordeal.\n\nFinally, they reached the hidden temple, a magnificent structure carved from living rock. Inside, guarded by ancient magic, lay the phoenix feather, glowing with an ethereal light.  Amara, her heart pounding, reached for the feather. As her fingers brushed its surface, a surge of power coursed through her, filling her with a sense of awe and responsibility. She knew then that her journey was just beginning. She was no longer just the lighthouse keeper's daughter, she was Amara, the protector of the desert, the bearer of the phoenix's fire, ready to face whatever the world threw her way. \n\n\n\n",
            "## The Beacon\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe desert wind whipped sand against the rickety wooden door of the lighthouse. Kai squinted through the dusty glass, searching for the first hint of dawn. He\u2019d been stationed here for six months, a solitary sentinel in a sea of endless dunes. The lighthouse, once a proud beacon of hope for lost sailors, now stood forgotten and rusted, a testament to a bygone era. Kai\u2019s only companions were the wind, the sand, and the memories that haunted him like the desert phantoms. \n\nHe missed the bustling port town, the salty tang of the sea, the warmth of human connection. He missed his family, his friends, the feeling of belonging. But he couldn\u2019t leave. Not until he fulfilled his promise. A promise made on a day that felt like a lifetime ago, a day when a fiery phoenix, rising from the ashes of his world, had whispered a cryptic prophecy. \"The lighthouse will guide you, but the desert will test you,\" it had said, its voice like crackling flames.\n\n**Middle**\n\nDays blurred into weeks, weeks into months. Kai meticulously maintained the lighthouse, polishing its tarnished brass, cleaning the dusty lens. He spent his nights scanning the horizon, searching for a sign, a glimmer of hope.  He felt like he was going mad, a prisoner of his own solitude. But he couldn't falter. The phoenix's prophecy echoed in his mind, a constant reminder of his purpose.\n\nOne particularly harsh night, a sandstorm raged, a howling beast of wind and grit that threatened to bury the lighthouse completely. Kai clung to his post, fear gnawing at his resolve. As the storm peaked, a desperate cry pierced the wind. A ship, caught in the maelstrom, was being tossed mercilessly by the waves.  Kai knew he had to act. Ignoring the howling wind, he scrambled up the winding staircase, his heart pounding in his chest. He flicked the switch, and the lighthouse's beam, long dormant, sliced through the storm, a beacon of hope in the raging darkness.\n\n**End**\n\nThe storm abated, leaving behind a sky streaked with the first light of dawn. The ship, battered but afloat, limped towards the shore.  Kai watched from the lighthouse, a wave of relief washing over him. He had fulfilled his purpose. As the ship disappeared into the distance, he felt a strange peace descend upon him. The phoenix's prophecy had come to pass. The desert had tested him, but the lighthouse had guided him. He had found his strength, his courage, and his redemption, not in the bustling ports of old, but in the heart of the unforgiving desert. \n\n\n"

            "August 14th\n\nThe city's symphony of sirens and car horns had been grating on my nerves all day. Work was a particularly frustrating whirlwind, and by the time I got home, I felt like a frayed wire, ready to snap. I knew I needed to do something, anything, to unwind. So, I grabbed my watercolour set and a blank canvas. \n\nForget the planned landscape I had in mind. Today, I just let my emotions guide me. The brush danced across the paper, splattering vibrant blues and angry reds, mirroring the turmoil inside. As the colours blended, a sense of calm settled over me. It wasn't a perfect painting, but it was honest, raw, and ultimately, freeing. \n\nLooking at it now, I see not chaos but a storm passing, leaving behind a sky tinged with the soft hues of hope. My hands are stained with paint, my heart feels lighter, and the world outside seems a little less jarring.\n\nWatercolouring is my sanctuary. It's a weekly ritual, usually on Sunday afternoons. It's a way to process my week, to release stress, and to remind myself of the beauty that exists even in the midst of chaos.  Sometimes, a splash of colour is all it takes to bring back the peace.  \n\n\n\n",
            "July 14th\n\nToday was one of those days. The kind where the world just feels too loud, too much. Work was stressful, the traffic was a nightmare, and by the time I got home, I felt like I was carrying around a backpack full of lead weights.  I knew I needed to do something, anything, to calm down before I completely lost it. So I did what I always do in these situations - I pulled out my watercolors. \n\nFor the next hour, the world outside my window ceased to exist. I sat at my kitchen table, the only sound the gentle scratching of my brush against paper. I let the colors flow, blending and swirling, creating a chaotic abstract mess that somehow mirrored the whirlwind in my head. But as I worked, the chaos started to feel less overwhelming, more like a controlled explosion. \n\nWhen I finally put down the brush, I felt a sense of calm I hadn't felt all day. The lead weights in my backpack had lifted, replaced by a lightness I hadn't realized I was missing.  \n\nWatercolor painting isn't just a hobby for me, it's a lifeline. I try to make time for it at least twice a week, usually on evenings when the day has been particularly rough. It's my way of processing emotions, of finding peace in the midst of the storm. And even if the result isn't a masterpiece, the act of creating something, anything, is always therapeutic.  \n\n",
            "August 12th\n\nThe rain hammered against my window today, mimicking the relentless drumming in my chest.  Work had been a nightmare, a constant barrage of demanding emails and impossible deadlines. By the time I got home, I felt like I was drowning.  \n\nBut then I remembered my promise to myself.  No matter what, I would dedicate at least thirty minutes to sketching tonight.  \n\nI dug out my worn sketchbook and a charcoal pencil, the familiar textures grounding me.  I didn't worry about creating anything \"good.\" Instead, I let my hand move freely, drawing the chaotic shapes and swirls that mirrored the storm outside.  \n\nAs the charcoal danced across the paper, my thoughts began to quiet.  The tension in my shoulders eased, replaced by the simple satisfaction of creating something, anything, with my own hands.  \n\nBy the time I finished, the rain had softened to a drizzle, and the air felt lighter.  The sketch wasn't perfect, a jumble of dark strokes and smudges, but it was mine.  And in that messy, imperfect creation, I found a strange sense of peace.\n\nI try to make time for sketching at least three times a week, usually on evenings when I feel overwhelmed or stressed.  It's my way of finding stillness in the chaos, of reminding myself that even in the midst of a storm, there's beauty to be found in the act of creation. \n\n\n\n",
            "Dear Diary,\n\nToday was one of those days. The kind where the weight of the world seems to sit heavy on your shoulders, and even breathing feels like an effort. Work was a whirlwind, the traffic was a nightmare, and my inbox was overflowing. I felt frayed, on edge, like a loose thread threatening to unravel.  \n\nBut then, I remembered my anchor: clay.\n\nI kneaded the cool, damp earth between my fingers, its texture grounding me in the present moment. I didn't have a plan, just let my hands guide me, shaping and molding the clay into abstract forms. Each smooth curve, each delicate ridge, felt like a knot untangling, a release of tension. The quiet focus of the process drowned out the noise of the day, replaced by the soft scrape of the clay against the table and the rhythmic rasp of my fingers.\n\nBy the time I was done, I felt different. Not \"fixed,\" but calmed. Lighter somehow. The world hadn't magically changed, but I had. My perspective had shifted, even slightly. The clay had absorbed some of the day's stress, leaving me with a sense of quiet peace.\n\nI usually try to carve out an hour for pottery every Sunday afternoon. It's my ritual of self-care, a way to reconnect with myself and let go of the week's anxieties.  Even on days like today, when I feel like I'm drowning, I know that a little bit of clay can bring me back to shore. \n\n\n\n",
            "Dear Diary,\n\nToday was one of those days. You know, the kind where the weight of everything just feels a little too heavy. Work deadlines loomed, the washing machine broke down again (seriously, this thing is possessed!), and the grocery store was out of my favorite tea. I felt myself spiraling into a pit of stress and frustration.  \n\nThen I remembered my coping mechanism: watercolors. I grabbed my paints, a blank canvas, and a worn-out paintbrush, and let myself be consumed by the activity. I didn't plan anything, just let the colors flow onto the paper, blending and swirling until something resembling a sunset emerged. The vibrant oranges, pinks, and purples calmed the storm brewing inside me. \n\nAs I focused on each brushstroke, the noise of the day faded away. My mind, usually racing with to-dos and worries, quieted down. By the time I finished, the sun had set for real, casting a warm glow on my messy studio. I felt lighter, the tension in my shoulders easing, replaced by a quiet sense of accomplishment.\n\nPainting isn't something I do every day, but it's become my go-to for those days when I need to recharge. Usually, I squeeze it in on Sunday afternoons, a quiet moment of self-care before the chaos of the week begins.\n\nEven if I don't manage to create a masterpiece, just the act of creating something beautiful for myself is enough to shift my perspective and remind me that there's still beauty to be found, even on the toughest days. \n\n\n\n"

You'll need to replace `<LICENSE_KEY>` with your actual Kublr license key and adjust the commands to match your Kublr installation process.\n\n* **WordPress Deployment:**\n    * **Persistent Volume:** The WordPress deployment uses a PersistentVolume to ensure data persistence.\n    * **HTTPS:** A placeholder for self-signed certificates is included.\n    * **Minimal Exposed Ports:**  The WordPress deployment is configured to expose only the necessary ports.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Placeholders:** You need to replace the following placeholders:\n    * `<LICENSE_KEY>` with your Kublr license key\n    * `<JOIN_TOKEN>` and `<HASH>` with the values obtained during the control-plane node initialization.\n* **Networking:** This example uses a private network. Adjust the network configuration to match your environment if needed.\n* **Security:**\n    * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms beyond the defaults provided by Kubernetes.\n    * Consider using a dedicated service account for WordPress and restrict its permissions.\n    * Harden your Kubernetes cluster by following best practices for securing your workloads and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n",

            "The answer is **d'**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* The sentence structure suggests a prepositional phrase is needed to complete the meaning. \n* \"Abans de\" is a common Catalan phrase meaning \"before\".\n\n\nThe full sentence translates to:  \"The factory closed temporarily before mandatory inspections and the workers were reassigned.\" \n",

If it does, the item is added to the `digit_only_items` list.\n\n2. **`unique_digits = sorted(set(\"\".join(digit_only_items)))`**:\n   -  `\"\".join(digit_only_items)`: This concatenates all the digit-only items into a single string.\n   - `set(...)`: This creates a set from the concatenated string, automatically removing duplicate digits.\n   - `sorted(...)`: This sorts the unique digits in ascending order.\n\n3. **`if unique_digits: ... else: ...`**: This checks if there are any unique digits found. If so, it prints them separated by commas and spaces. Otherwise, it prints -1.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try another example!\n",
            "Here's how we can solve this:\n\n1. **Identify numeric items:**  We need to find the items in the list that consist only of digits. These are: '304', '90', '007', and '5'.\n\n2. **Extract digits:** From each numeric item, we extract the individual digits.\n\n3. **Combine and sort:** We combine all the extracted digits and sort them in ascending order.\n\n**Code (Python):**\n\n```python\ndef extract_digits(items):\n  digits = set()\n  for item in items:\n    if item.isdigit():\n      for digit in item:\n        digits.add(int(digit))\n  if digits:\n    return ', '.join(str(digit) for digit in sorted(digits))\n  else:\n    return -1\n\nitems = ['304', 'b', '12a', '90', '007', 'x', '5']\nresult = extract_digits(items)\nprint(result)  # Output: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9 \n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `isdigit()` method checks if a string consists only of digits.\n* We use a `set` to store unique digits.\n*  We convert digits to strings using `str(digit)` for joining them later.\n* `', '.join(...)`  joins the sorted digits with commas and spaces.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see the solution in a different programming language!"
